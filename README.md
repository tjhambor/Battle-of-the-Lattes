**What is Gini?**
"The Gini coefficient, or Gini index, is the most commonly used measure of inequality. It was developed by Italian statistician Corrado Gini." (https://ourworldindata.org/what-is-the-gini-coefficient)"A Gini index of 0 represents perfect equality, while an index of 100 implies perfect inequality." (https://databank.worldbank.org/metadataglossary/world-development-indicators/series/SI.POV.GINI). The findings found in this report would indicate massive financial inequality among countries. For example, in Sweden the Gini is calculted at 87.4 and the price of a Starbucks tall latte is $5.72CAD. Columbia's Gini is slightly less coming in at 83.1 but they pay significantly less for the same coffee for only $2.69CAD.

**What Makes Starbucks so Popular?**
Like the Apple products, Starbucks carries with it a certain amount of pop and circumstance. Holding a Starbucks coffee can elicit a sense of pride and oppulence. Marketing has played a huge role from their humble beginnings.
